# Ai Powered Eating Habits

An AI Software Engineering Project: to help you transform your eating habits and reach your ideal bodyweight.

# 0. Project Summary

- **Problem:** Personalized eating habits guidance.
- **Why it matters:** A low-cost approach to a healthy, effective diet.
- **Approach:** Log your morning bodyweight and tell the bot what you just ate.
- **Success metric:** Progress toward your target bodyweight.
- **Key risk:** Users may not consistently log meals or engage with the bot.

# 1. Problem Framing & Success Metrics

## Business / User Problem

Describe the underlying problem in plain language. Who is the user? What pain point or workflow does this solve? Why is AI engineering the right approach (vs. traditional software, rule-based systems, or classical ML)?

## Goal

Specific, measurable goal(s). What does "solved" look like? Tie to user outcomes and timelines.

## Stakeholders

List key people/teams and their roles/ownership (PM, Eng, Design, Data, Legal, etc.).

## Prior Work

Summarize past attempts, related products/tools, or heuristic solutions. Include links if relevant.

## Input and Output

A brief description of what data goes into the system, and what the system outputs. Also consider what data you will need to store, and where.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Latency (p50 / p99) | | e.g., < 2s for chat, < 5s for research tasks |
| Cost per request | | e.g., < $0.03 avg |
| Quality bar | | e.g., 90%+ user satisfaction, < 5% hallucination rate |
| Privacy / compliance | | e.g., no PII in logs, GDPR compliant |
| Availability / uptime | | e.g., 99.5% uptime |

## Success Metrics

Define metrics at three levels:

- User-facing metrics: Task completion rate, user satisfaction (thumbs up/down, CSAT), time saved vs. manual process.
- Technical metrics: Response quality (LLM-as-judge scores, human ratings, accuracy on test cases), hallucination rate, format compliance rate.
- System metrics: Latency (p50/p99), cost per request, error rate, uptime.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have strong evidence that the problem I'm trying to solve is an important problem to solve.
- [ ] I have strong evidence that an LLM-based approach is the right tool for this problem (vs. traditional software, rule-based, or classical ML).
- [ ] The goals and metrics align with user needs and/or team priorities.
- [ ] I have shared the scope with relevant stakeholders and flagged dependencies.
- [ ] I have documented key decisions and trade-offs in my README or decision log.

# 2. Prompt Engineering & Systematic Tracking

## Prompt Architecture

Describe the overall prompt strategy. How many distinct prompts does your system use? What roles do they play (system prompt, few-shot examples, templates, output parsers)?

## Prompt Organization

Describe how prompts are stored and versioned. Prompts should be treated as separate components — not hardcoded in application files.

Example structure:

```text
prompts/
├── system_prompts/
│   ├── assistant_v1.txt
│   ├── assistant_v2.txt
│   └── summarizer_v1.txt
├── few_shot_examples/
│   ├── classification_examples.json
│   └── query_reformulation_examples.json
└── templates/
    └── rag_response_template.txt
```

## Evaluation Framework

Describe your test set and evaluation approach for prompts.

| Evaluation Aspect | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Test set size | e.g., 100–300 test cases |
| Test set composition | Cover different question types, difficulty levels, edge cases |
| Metrics | e.g., LLM-as-judge scores, BLEU/ROUGE, exact match, format compliance |
| Evaluation tooling | e.g., manual review, PromptLayer, Langfuse, Weights & Biases |
| Update cadence | How often is the test set refreshed with new failure patterns? |

## Checklist

- [ ] Prompts are stored in separate versioned files, not hardcoded.
- [ ] I have a structured test set with diverse cases and expected outputs/criteria.
- [ ] I have a repeatable evaluation process for comparing prompt versions.
- [ ] Prompt changes are tested against the evaluation set before deployment.
- [ ] I have documented my prompt iteration history and key learnings.

# 3. Model Selection & Evaluation

## Candidate Models

| Model | Provider | Cost (input/output) | Latency (est.) | Quality Notes | License |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | Ensure the license works for your use case |

## Evaluation Approach

Describe how you'll compare models. Run each candidate on the same test set and compare performance, cost, and latency using a consistent rubric.

## Model Routing (if applicable)

If using multiple models, describe the routing strategy. e.g., a cheap/fast model classifies query difficulty and routes simple queries to a small model and complex queries to a larger one.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have tested at least 2–3 models from different providers/sizes on my test set.
- [ ] I have compared performance, cost, and latency in a structured way.
- [ ] I have ensured the model licenses are appropriate for my use case.
- [ ] I have documented the rationale for my final model choice(s).
- [ ] If using model routing, I have tested and documented the routing logic.

# 4. RAG Implementation

Skip this section if your project does not use RAG.

## Data Sources

| Source | Type | Volume | Update Frequency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

## Chunking Strategy

| Strategy Tested | Chunk Size | Overlap | Retrieval Accuracy | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

Test multiple strategies (fixed-size, semantic, recursive, etc.) on your specific data and measure retrieval accuracy.

## Embedding Model & Vector Store

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedding model | e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, Sentence Transformers | |
| Vector store | e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate | |

## Retrieval Strategy

Describe the search approach: semantic similarity, hybrid search (keyword + semantic), re-ranking, query expansion, etc. Document what you tested and the improvement each technique provided.

## RAG Evaluation

| Metric | Description | Baseline | Current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval accuracy (Precision@K) | % of retrieved chunks that are relevant | | |
| Retrieval recall (Recall@K) | % of relevant chunks retrieved | | |
| Answer accuracy (given good chunks) | Does the LLM produce correct answers with correct context? | | |
| End-to-end accuracy | Does the whole system produce correct answers? | | |

## Checklist

- [ ] I have tested multiple chunking strategies and documented results.
- [ ] I have evaluated at least two embedding models.
- [ ] I have a retrieval test set (20–30+ questions with known answer locations).
- [ ] I can isolate whether failures come from retrieval or generation.
- [ ] I have documented the improvement from each retrieval enhancement (re-ranking, hybrid search, query expansion, etc.).

# 5. Agent Systems

Skip this section if your project does not use agents.

## Agent Architecture

| Security | Input validation, sandboxed execution, access control | |
| Infinite loop prevention | Max iterations, loop detection, cost budgets | |
| Guardrails | Content filtering, output validation, human-in-the-loop for high-stakes actions | |
| Cost monitoring | | Ensure the agents don’t bankrupt you 🙂 |

## Agent Evaluation

| Test Type | # Tests | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests (individual tools) | | |
| Integration tests (complete workflows) | | |
| Adversarial tests | | |
| Representative task suite | | Simple to complex tasks; measure task completion rate, avg steps to completion |

## Checklist

# 7. System Monitoring & Error Analysis

## Component-Level Monitoring

| Component | Metrics to Track |
| --- | --- |
| Prompts | Response quality scores, format compliance, refusal rate, avg response length |
| RAG | Retrieval confidence scores, # chunks retrieved, source diversity, retrieval latency |
| Agents | Task completion rate, avg steps to completion, tool success rates, error types, cost per task |
| Overall system | End-to-end success rate, user satisfaction, latency, cost per request, error rate, uptime |

## Logging

At minimum, log for each request: timestamp, user query, components used (which chunks retrieved, which model, which prompt version), response, latency, cost, and any errors.

| Logging Approach | Tool/Method |
| --- | --- |
| Basic | File or SQLite database |
| Advanced | e.g., Langfuse, LangSmith, Weights & Biases, custom observability stack |

## Error Analysis Process

Describe how you regularly review failures, categorize error types, and feed learnings back into improving prompts, RAG configuration, or agent logic.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have structured logging for every request.
- [ ] I track cost, latency, and quality metrics over time.
- [ ] I have a process for reviewing and categorizing errors.
- [ ] I have a feedback loop: errors inform prompt/RAG/agent improvements.
- [ ] I have alerting for critical metric regressions (if applicable).

# 8. Fine-Tuning (Optional / Advanced)

Only pursue fine-tuning if you've optimized everything else and have a clear reason.

## Use Case for Fine-Tuning

Why fine-tuning is appropriate here (e.g., consistent output formatting, matching a larger model's performance with a smaller model, domain-specific language, embedding model tuning for RAG).

## Approach

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Training data | # examples, how they were created, quality assurance |
| Base model | Which model are you fine-tuning? Why this model? |
| Baseline | Performance of best prompt-only approach on held-out test set |
| Versions trained | Different data sizes, epochs, learning rates |
| Performance comparison | Does fine-tuned model beat baseline? By how much? |

## Checklist

- [ ] I have exhausted prompt engineering and RAG optimizations before resorting to fine-tuning.
- [ ] I have a high-quality training dataset (100–500+ examples).
- [ ] I have a baseline to compare against.
- [ ] I have trained multiple versions and tracked results.
- [ ] I have documented whether fine-tuning was worth the effort.
